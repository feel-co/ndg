[{"id":"1","title":"Postprocessing","content":"Postprocessing\nNDG supports postprocessing of generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to optimize output size and performance. Postprocessing is optional and disabled by default, however, testing and bug reports are welcome :)\nConfiguration\nPostprocessing behaviour of NDG is configured either through the [postprocess] section in ndg.toml, or via CLI flags. To configure it in your ndg.toml:\nOr, alternatively, by using CLI overrides:\nOptions\nTop-Level Options\nOptionTypeDefaultDescriptionminify_htmlbooleanfalseEnable HTML minificationminify_cssbooleanfalseEnable CSS minificationminify_jsbooleanfalseEnable JavaScript minificationHTML Options\nOptionTypeDefaultDescriptionremove_commentsbooleantrueRemove HTML comments from outputMinification\nNDG supports minification of HTML, CSS and Javascript files for smaller production documents at the cost of a tiny increase in generation time. In most cases the cost is negligible, and the decrease of the document size is well worth the penalty. However, this feature is completely optional.\nIf you are deploying your documentation to production, and if bandwidth and file size matters you will almost certainly want to enable minification. This is a low-risk, high-reward feature that will likely yield faster page loads. You will, however, want to disable minification if you are developing locally and need readable source files. Additionally, you may wish to avoid minification if you are aiming for the absolutely fastest document generation.\nHTML Minification\nUses minify-html for fast, spec-compliant HTML minification. While enabled, NDG:\nRemoves unnecessary whitespace while preserving content\nRespects whitespace-sensitive elements (<pre>, <code>, etc.)\nRemoves HTML comments (configurable)\nRemoves optional closing tags where safe\nCollapses boolean attributes\n\nFor example, for a given config:\nand the input:\nYou will receive the following output:\nCSS Minification\nWe use the lightningcss crate pulled by the minify-html crate for production-grade CSS minification with parsing and optimization. This primarily affects large stylesheets, such as the ones provided by the default NDG template. While enabled, NDG:\nRemoves unnecessary whitespace and comments\nOptimizes color values (#ff0000 -> red)\nMerges duplicate rules\nRemoves unused prefixes\nValidates CSS syntax during processing\n\nFor example, for a given config:\nand the input:\nYou will receive the following output:\nJavaScript Minification\nWe rely on the relatively new, but battle-tested oxc_minifier crate for production-grade JavaScript minification with comprehensive optimizations and dead code elimination. Besides speed, it boasts 100% correctness. While enabled, NDG:\nRemoves whitespace and comments\nFolds constants (1 + 2 -> 3)\nEliminates dead code (removes unused functions)\nOptimizes expressions (comma operators, etc.)\nValidates syntax during processing\n\nFor example, for a given config:\nand the input:\nYou will receive the following output:\nComplete Example\nPerformance Impact\nPostprocessing adds overhead to the build process but reduces output size:\nFile TypeTypical ReductionBuild Time ImpactHTML10-20%MinimalCSS20-40%LowJavaScript15-30%LowFor most documentation sites, the build time impact is negligible (< 1 second for typical projects).\nError Handling\nIf minification fails (e.g., invalid CSS or JavaScript syntax), NDG will report the error and stop the build. This helps catch syntax errors early:\nTo debug minification errors:\nDisable minification for the failing file type\nFix the syntax error\nRe-enable minification\n\nExtensibility\nThe postprocessing pipeline is quite new, but it is designed to be very extensible. Each file type has detailed processor function with its own configuration options. This design is obviously not for fun, as future postprocessing capabilities are planned. Though, do not expect anything crazy. I find postprocessing to be a little hacky, and it is only a last resort after actual feature implementations.","path":"POSTPROCESSING.html","tokens":["css","respects","validates","typical","typetypical","developing","early","document","low-risk","production-grade","this","adds","overhead","error","detailed","crazy","its","whitespace-sensitive","optimizes","oxc_minifier","negligible","wish","expect","process","options","functions","hacky","fastest","documentation","via","testing","optiontypedefaultdescriptionremove_commentsbooleantrueremove","reductionbuild","pipeline","files","well","tiny","use","type","planned","outputminification","debug","crate","stop","optimization","large","relatively","quite","affects","function","errors","minify-html","configurable","example","fast","tags","merges","loads","capabilities","color","given","template","comma","etc","lowfor","though","fun","boolean","readable","minimalcss20-40","optimizations","design","your","only","folds","faster","smaller","processor","locally","rules","correctness","minificationminify_cssbooleanfalseenable","during","the","has","minificationminify_jsbooleanfalseenable","yield","decrease","failing","re-enable","feature","operators","sites","documents","generation","boasts","overrides","section","will","however","lightningcss","processing","invalid","that","you","additionally","file","cases","configuration","javascript","absolutely","penalty","each","primarily","rely","pre","attributes","using","top-level","from","behaviour","spec-compliant","unnecessary","red","reduces","catch","reports","second","comprehensive","closing","while","values","code","config","parsing","own","provided","almost","pulled","worth","projects","content","receive","deploying","where","uses","configure","supports","little","for","want","obviously","100","future","dead","output","handling","impact","preserving","constants","complete","after","page","last","postprocessing","toml","production","speed","with","extensibility","very","postprocess","impacthtml10-20","enable","increase","disabled","flags","aiming","elimination","ndg","either","cost","completely","designed","configured","stylesheets","need","and","such","ones","besides","not","syntax","comments","lowjavascript15-30","optional","new","actual","bandwidth","whitespace","welcome","source","through","html","are","input","generated","build","certainly","safe","enabled","removes","report","matters","high-reward","cli","battle-tested","optimize","bug","fails","fix","default","optiontypedefaultdescriptionminify_htmlbooleanfalseenable","extensible","disable","time","minificationhtml","collapses","duplicate","following","ff0000","most","avoid","eliminates","minification","unused","anything","alternatively","resort","performance","prefixes","but","find","elements","likely","may","size","helps","implementations","expressions"],"title_tokens":["postprocessing"],"anchors":[{"text":"Postprocessing","id":"postprocessing","level":1,"tokens":["postprocessing"]},{"text":"Configuration","id":"configuration","level":2,"tokens":["configuration"]},{"text":"Options","id":"options","level":2,"tokens":["options"]},{"text":"Top-Level Options","id":"top-level-options","level":3,"tokens":["options","top-level"]},{"text":"HTML Options","id":"html-options","level":3,"tokens":["options","html"]},{"text":"Minification","id":"minification","level":2,"tokens":["minification"]},{"text":"HTML Minification","id":"html-minification","level":3,"tokens":["minification","html"]},{"text":"CSS Minification","id":"css-minification","level":3,"tokens":["css","minification"]},{"text":"JavaScript Minification","id":"javascript-minification","level":3,"tokens":["javascript","minification"]},{"text":"Complete Example","id":"complete-example","level":3,"tokens":["complete","example"]},{"text":"Performance Impact","id":"performance-impact","level":3,"tokens":["performance","impact"]},{"text":"Error Handling","id":"error-handling","level":3,"tokens":["error","handling"]},{"text":"Extensibility","id":"extensibility","level":2,"tokens":["extensibility"]}]},{"id":"2","title":"Search","content":"Search\nNDG includes a built-in search system that indexes your documentation pages and their headings, enabling quick navigation through your content.

powered by Tera and backed by our own templating logic. Using this system, you may customize the appearance and structure of your generated documentation while avoiding what could be referred to as a \"vendor lock-in\".\nTemplate Types\nThere are several \"special\" templates that is expected during documentation generation. NDG bundles its own templates that will be used by default, but you may override them as you wish to make your documentation site truly unique.\nCore Templates\ndefault.html - Main template for documentation pages\noptions.html - Template for NixOS module options page\nsearch.html - Template for the search page\nnavbar.html - Navigation bar template (shared across all pages)\nfooter.html - Footer template (shared across all pages)\noptions_toc.html - Table of contents template for options page\n\nAssets\ndefault.css - Default stylesheet\nmain.js - Scripts loaded for interactivity\nsearch.js - Secondary script used for the search functionality\n\nUsing Custom Templates\nAs mentioned before, you may\nTemplate Directory\nUsing the template directory is the recommended way of overriding default templates of NDG. In this method, you must use a template directory containing all your custom templates:\nOr in your ndg.toml:\n[!TIP] The ndg export-templates command can be used to create a directory with the default templates, meant to be overridden by the user. ndg will prioritize templates provided by the user wherever provided. Missing page templates will cause ndg to use the default template for that page variant. E.g., providing a template directory with just default.html would use the default.html provided by the user, but the built-in templates for rest of the templatable components.\nIndividual Template File\nA dirty legacy method of quickly overriding default.html exists as --template. This allows providing a quick override for only the default template, which may be useful if you only want to override styles for arbitrary generated pages, and not special pages or components such as the navbar.\nThis will use my-custom-template.html as the default.html template.\nPer-File Templates\nYou can create file-specific templates that will be used instead of default.html for matching markdown files.\nExample:\nfoo.md -> will use foo.html template if it exists, otherwise falls back to default.html\nabout.md -> will use about.html template if it exists, otherwise falls back to default.html\n\nThis is useful when you want different layouts for different sections of your documentation. It can also be used for, e.g., 404.html to generate your own 404 page with Markdown.\nTemplate Components\nNavbar Template (navbar.html)\nCustomize the navigation bar that appears in the header of all pages.\nAvailable Variables:\n{{ has_options }} - HTML attributes for options link styling (e.g., class=\"active\")\n{{ generate_search }} - Boolean indicating if search is enabled\n{{ options_path }} - Relative path to options page\n{{ search_path }} - Relative path to search page\n\nExample\nFooter Template (footer.html)\nCustomize the footer that appears at the bottom of all pages.\nAvailable Variables:\n{{ footer_text }} - Footer text from configuration\n\nExample\nExporting Default Templates\nTo export all default templates for customization:\nThis will create a directory with all default templates that you can then modify.\nUse --force to overwrite existing files:\nTemplate Variables\nCommon Variables (Available in all templates)\n{{ title }} - Page title\n{{ site_title }} - Site title from configuration\n{{ footer_text }} - Footer text from configuration\n{{ content|safe }} - Rendered markdown content\n{{ toc|safe }} - Table of contents HTML\n{{ doc_nav|safe }} - Document navigation HTML\n{{ navbar_html|safe }} - Rendered navbar HTML\n{{ footer_html|safe }} - Rendered footer HTML\n{{ has_options }} - Options link styling attributes\n{{ generate_search }} - Boolean for search feature\n{{ custom_scripts|safe }} - Custom scripts HTML\n{{ meta_tags_html|safe }} - Meta tags HTML\n{{ opengraph_html|safe }} - OpenGraph tags HTML\n\nAsset Paths\n{{ stylesheet_path }} - Path to stylesheet\n{{ main_js_path }} - Path to main JavaScript file\n{{ search_js_path }} - Path to search JavaScript file\n{{ index_path }} - Path to index page\n{{ options_path }} - Path to options page\n{{ search_path }} - Path to search page\n\nOptions Page Specific\n{{ heading }} - Page heading\n{{ options|safe }} - Rendered options HTML\n\nTemplate Syntax\nTemplates use the Tera templating engine, which is similar to Jinja2/Django templates. Below are some examples provided for your convenience. Please refer to the Tera's documentation for more details. Everything supported by Tera is supported in NDG's templated documents.\nVariables\nUse the safe filter to render HTML without escaping:\nConditionals\nLoops\nExample: Custom Theme\nHere's an example of creating a custom theme:\nExport the default templates:\nCustomize the templates in ./my-theme/\nModify navbar.html to add custom links:\nUpdate footer.html:\nCreate a custom template for your homepage (index.html):\n\nNow you may use the custom theme freely using the --template-dir option.\nConfiguration Example\nIn ndg.toml:\nBest Practices\nFor a clean(er) experience, we recommend that you:\nStart with defaults: Export the default templates and modify them rather than starting from scratch\nKeep it modular: Use the navbar and footer templates to keep common elements consistent\nPreserve CSS classes: Keep the default CSS classes to maintain functionality (sidebar toggle, search, etc.)\n\nThe nature of a mixed-approach that NDG supports may sometimes yield results that can be best described as annoying. Though it is perfectly possible to have a good design and keep your sanity.\nTroubleshooting\nTemplate not found\nMake sure your template directory contains the required templates or that fallback templates are available.\nVariables not rendering\nCheck variable names match the documentation\nUse {{ variable|safe }} for HTML content\nCheck for typos in variable names\n\nStyling issues\nEnsure your custom CSS doesn't conflict with default styles\nCheck that CSS classes used by JavaScript features are preserved\nTest responsive design on mobile devices\n\nPer-file template not working\nEnsure the template filename matches the markdown filename (e.g., foo.html for foo.md)\nCheck that the template is in the configured template directory\nVerify the template has valid Tera

There are several subcommands to handle different documentation tasks.\nYou can review ndg html and ndg manpage commands' help texts to get more insight.\nQuickstart\nThe easiest and fastest way to get started with NDG is using the init subcommand to generate a configuration file, and tweak it per your needs.\nUpon running ndg init, you will receive a configuration file in one of JSON or TOML formats depending on the format specified, with all available options and their default values as well as explanatory comments. You can then edit this file to customize your documentation generation process.\n[!TIP] The generated configuration includes detailed comments for each option, making it easy to understand what each setting does without needing to refer to the documentation.\nOnce you have a configuration file, NDG will automatically detect it when ran in the same directory. Though if you want to move the configuration file to a nonstandard location, you may specify a path to the configuration file using the --config-file option.\nUpon running ndg init, you will receive a configuration file in one of JSON or TOML formats depending on the format specified, with all available options and their default values as well as explanatory comments.

Though if you want to move the configuration file to a nonstandard location, you may specify a path to the configuration file using the --config-file option.\nGenerating Your First Documents\nTo generate your documents, NDG requires one of two things: Markdown Sources or options.json. Alternatively, for more comprehensive documents, you can provide both. The latter will be used for an options.html with your module options in the case Markdown sources are provided.\nThe Markdown sources are expected in an \"inputs\" directory, in which you can dump your Markdown files with ndg-flavored Commonmark, and they will be converted to HTML following the same structure. For example:\nAssuming your input directory (--input-dir) is inputs/, you will receive the following output:\nYou will notice the index.html and options.html documents representing index.md and options.md from the inputs directory. The assets directory and the search.html document are special outputs generated by NDG. We'll talk about them later in the templates section.\nThis is the operating principle of NDG: you give it some Markdown inputs, and you receive some HTML documents. It is all structured, so you can worry less about site design and more about writing documentation. You do write documentation, right?\nWe'll continue talking about HTML generation in the relevant section. For now, let's take a look at how to configure NDG to fit your needs.\nDetailed Usage\nCLI Flags and Configuration Options\nThe CLI flags are the alternative method of configuring NDG, and can be used in conjunction with the configuration file. While used together, the CLI flags can be used to provide ad-hoc overrides of specific NDG behaviour provided by the configuration file, or the default configuration, such as page indexing for search and code highlighting. Two example flags accepted by ndg html are:\n--generate-search: Enables search functionality (disabled by default if omitted).\n--highlight-code: Enables syntax highlighting for code blocks (disabled by default if omitted).\n\nExample usage:\nIn this example we're telling NDG to look for Markdown sources in the docs/ directory using the --input-dir flag and to dump the result in html/ using the --output-dir flag. Additionally, the --title and --generate-search flags ensure that we use the correct title in the site's navbar, and to generate search data.\nThose flags will override the relevant values in the ndg configuration, e.g., ndg.toml if provided. If you do not need a full configuration, you may simply use the flags above to generate a complete documentation site without ever needing to create your configuration. Do note, however, that some configuration options are ONLY available in ndg.toml, and will not be available to override from the CLI.\nConfiguration Files\nNDG accepts two distinct configuration formats, TOML and JSON, to allow setting your options persistently. Options like search.enable can be set in the config file, but CLI flags will override them if provided.\nTOML is the \"blessed\" format for NDG, though JSON is fully supported thanks to Serde. The default format for generated configuration files is TOML.\nExample ndg.toml:\nInteractions Between CLI and Config\n[!NOTE] CLI flags always take precedence over config file settings. For instance, if your config file has search.enable = false, but you run ndg html --generate-search, search will be enabled.\nIf neither CLI nor config specifies an option, ndg uses sensible defaults (e.g., search.enable defaults to true if omitted from both; CLI flags override config when present). For a full list of CLI options, see the help output with ndg html --help.\nConfiguration Reference\nBelow is a comprehensive list of configuration options available in ndg.toml:\nBasic Options:\ninput_dir - Path to directory containing Markdown files\noutput_dir - Output directory for generated documentation (default: \"build\")\ntitle - Documentation title (default: \"ndg documentation\")\nfooter_text - Footer text (default: \"Generated with ndg\")\njobs - Number of threads for parallel processing (default: auto-detected)\n\nFeature Toggles:\nsearch.enable - Enable search functionality (default: true)\nsearch.max_heading_level - Maximum heading level to index (default: 6)\nhighlight_code - Enable syntax highlighting (default: true)\ngenerate_anchors - Generate heading anchors (default: true)\n\nAdvanced Options:\ntemplate_path - Path to custom template file\ntemplate_dir - Directory containing custom templates\nstylesheet_paths - Array of custom stylesheet paths\nscript_paths - Array of custom JavaScript file paths\nassets_dir - Directory containing additional assets to copy\nmodule_options - Path to options.json for NixOS module documentation\noptions_toc_depth - Depth of option categories in TOC (default: 2)\nmanpage_urls_path - Path to manpage URL mappings JSON file\nrevision - Git revision for source file links (default: \"local\")\ntab_style - How to handle tabs in code blocks: \"none\", \"warn\", or \"normalize\" (default: \"none\")\n\nMetadata Options:\nopengraph - Table of OpenGraph meta tags (e.g., { \"og:title\" = \"My Docs\", \"og:image\" = \"...\" })\nmeta_tags - Table of additional HTML meta tags (e.g., { description = \"...\", keywords = \"...\" })\n\nExample configuration:\nAdvanced Configuration Details\nParallel Processing (jobs):\nThe jobs option controls how many threads NDG uses for processing files. By default, NDG auto-detects the number of CPU cores. For large documentation sets, this significantly speeds up generation:\nTab Handling (tab_style):\nControls how hard tabs in code blocks are handled:\n\"none\" - Leave tabs as-is (default)\n\"warn\" - Log warnings when tabs are detected\n\"normalize\" - Convert tabs to spaces (4 spaces per tab)\n\nThis is useful for ensuring consistent code block rendering across browsers.\nManpage URL Mappings (manpage_urls_path):\nProvides a JSON file mapping manpage references to URLs. This allows NDG to automatically link manpage citations in your documentation:\nCustom Assets (assets_dir, stylesheet_paths, script_paths):\nassets_dir - Directory to copy wholesale into the output (images, fonts, etc.)\nstylesheet_paths - Additional CSS files to include (can specify multiple)\nscript_paths - Additional JavaScript files to include (can specify multiple)\n\nExample:\nSEO and Social Media (opengraph, meta_tags):\nThese options inject metadata into the HTML <head> for better SEO and social media sharing:\nGenerating HTML Documents\nAs of v2.0.0, NDG features a more compartmentalized architechture with a focus on distinguishing between output formats more carefully. Prior to version 2.0.0, HTML was the \"default\" output format, and the only \"blessed\" one.\nIn more recent versions of NDG, HTML support is fully mature and is available under the html subcommand. The html subcommand includes the following options:\nAs covered in the previous chapters, you must NDG an input directory containing your markdown files (--input-dir), an output directory (--output-dir) to put the created files, and a title (--title) for basic functionality. Alternatively, those can all be read from a config file, passed to ndg through the --config-file option.\nFor example:\nFor this example, ./ndg-example/docs contains markdown files that you would like to convert, and ./ndg-example/html is the result directory after the conversion.\n[!INFO] Optionally you may pass an options.json to also render an options.html page for a listing of your module options. See the NixOS Options section below for more details.\nGenerating Manpages\nNDG allows generating manual pages for your project using your options.json. Due to the shortcomings of Troff, manpage generation is not as robust or mature as HTML. Nevertheless, the manpage subcommand allows generating a manpage from your options:\n[!NOTE] For manpages, you must provide an options.json using --module-options or -j. Since we do not convert arbitrary pages in the Manpages mode, this is necessary to generate the main page containing module options.\nCustomization\nNDG is an opinionated CLI utility due to the reasons that warranted its existence, but it still aims to support various colorful customization options to tailor the output to your needs, regardless of how immodest they may be.\nThe HTML output design is handcrafted for Hjem by default as a small internal template, and while this is suitable for a majority of use cases, it may not be for you. If you would like to go above and beyond, or simply are not very keen on those templates, you are encouraged to export the default templates and iterate on them as you wish.\nNDG provides an export subcommand that exports the default templates into a specified directory of your choosing. You may modify those templates as you wish, and use them in document generation by passing the --template-dir flag to ndg html.\nYou can also provide a single template file using the --template option:\n[!NOTE] The --template flag will ONLY override the default template, which is used in the generation of the converted Markdown pages. To modify search and options pages, you may want to export the templates in full and modify them per your needs. This is an escape hatch for simple tweaks to converted pages.\nWhen using a template directory, ndg will look for the following files:\ndefault.html - Main template for documentation pages\noptions.html - Template for options page\nsearch.html - Template for search page\noptions_toc.html - Template for options table of contents\ndefault.css - Default stylesheet\nsearch.js - Search functionality JavaScript\n\nFor any missing files, ndg will fall back to its internal templates.\nCustom templates use the Tera templating engine, so your templates should use Tera syntax. Below are the variables that ndg will attempt to replace.\n{{ title }} - Document title\n{{ content|safe }} - Main content area (unescaped HTML)\n{{ toc|safe }} - Table of contents (unescaped HTML)\n{{ doc_nav|safe }} - Navigation links to other documents (unescaped HTML)\n{{ has_options|safe }} - Conditional display for options page link\n{{ footer_text }} - Footer text specified via the --footer option\n{{ generate_search }} - Boolean indicating whether search functionality is enabled\n{{ stylesheet_path }} - Path to the stylesheet (automatically adjusted for subdirectories)\n{{ main_js_path }} - Path to the main JavaScript file (automatically adjusted for subdirectories)\n{{ search_js_path }} - Path to the search JavaScript file (automatically adjusted for subdirectories)\n{{ index_path }} - Path to the index page (automatically adjusted for subdirectories)\n{{ options_path }} - Path to the options page (automatically adjusted for subdirectories)\n{{ search_path }} - Path to the search page (automatically adjusted for subdirectories)\n{{ custom_scripts|safe }} - Custom script tags (unescaped HTML, automatically adjusted for subdirectories)\n\nEach template can use these variables as needed. For example, in the default.html template:\nOnce exported, you can customize any of these files and use them with the --template-dir option:\nThis workflow is designed to aid developers avoid rebuilds, and to make sure users always start with the latest default templates and can easily update them when ndg is upgraded. Though, ndg will fall back to internal templates when none are provided.\nSee the templating documentation for details about the templating. If your use-case is not supported, feel free to request a feature!\nSidebar Customization\nNDG allows you to customize the sidebar navigation through flexible configuration options. You can control item ordering, add numbering, and customize titles using pattern-based matching:\nThis enables features like:\nSequential numbering of sidebar items\nCustom ordering (alphabetical, custom position-based, or filesystem)\nPattern-based title customization using exact or regex matching\nFlexible positioning for specific documentation items\n\nFor documentation generated from Nix module options, you can also customize the options sidebar to control visibility, naming, ordering, and depth of option categories. This is particularly useful for large module systems like NixOS or Home Manager configurations.\nSee the sidebar configuration guide for complete documentation including examples, use cases, and best practices.\nTemplate Customization Made Easy\nCustom Stylesheet\nNDG also bundles its own stylesheet as a part of the default templates. This is meant to be a simple starting point, but you may easily override it with your own stylesheets if you are not satisfied with the defaults. The --stylesheet flag allows overriding the default CSS template with your own.\n[!WARNING] While overriding the CSS, it is strongly recommended that you do not partially override the files. This mechanism is intended for quick and dirty edits rather than full replacements, because the default HTML templates depend on CSS classes in the default stylesheet. If you would like to start fresh, you should consider exporting the default template, and overriding it in full.\nNDG is able to compile SCSS as well, should you choose to pass it a file with the .scss extension. The stylesheet will be compiled in runtime, and placed as a .css file in the output directory.\nNixOS Options\nOne of the many purposes of NDG is to document options provided by the Nix module system. This behaviour is similar to nixos-render-docs used in the Nixpkgs manual, and is fully backwards compatible in terms of the file format expected by the utility.\nTo include a page listing NixOS options, provide a path to your options.json file:\nWhile there is no clear standard, the options.json is expected to be in the same \"standard\" format as the utility used by NixOS. In a traditional setup, you can generate this file using pkgs.nixosOptionsDoc by providing it with evaluated modules. If you are using the ndg-builder package instead of the raw CLI, module evaluation is done for you automatically.\n[!TIP] An example from nvf, created via pkgs.nixosOptionsDoc.\nSearch Configuration\nYour documentation may get convoluted as it grows more comprehensive (because you write such good docs!) so NDG includes the option to generate\nA search page with full indexing\nA search widget with limited functionality\n\nto search across your pages and option references. This used to be enabled by default prior to version v2.4 but it now defaults to false to avoid invasive behaviour and keep builds lightweight. You may re-enable the search page generating by passing the --generate-search flag to ndg html\nWhile the search is disabled, all search-related functionality will be skipped during runtime.\nUsing & Integrating with Nix\nBesides the CLI, NDG provides a simple but handy interface to interact directly with your Nix modules. While we recommend writing your own package to work with NDG, a very basic builder is provided under the NDG repository to wrap and configure NDG for you. This is done by the ndg-builder package, available from our flake outputs.\nUsing NDG with Nix\nInstalling NDG with Nix is the recommended way of generating documentation for your Nix projects. There are several ways to use NDG with Nix:\nInstalling from the Flake\nThe simplest and fastest way of using NDG is getting it directly from our Nix flake. A ndg package is exported, and it can be consumed in one of two ways:\nUse NDG using the Nix3 CLI:\nAdd NDG to your flake inputs, and use its packages in your project\n\nWe generally recommend fetching NDG using Nixpkgs fetchers or npins. Due to the inefficiency of Nix Flakes, using NDG as a flake input causes it to be fetched each time the input is updated even if NDG is not actually in use. Using Nixpkgs fetchers and npins allows benefiting from laziness.\nSee how Hjem does it for an example of utilizing Npins for this task.\nUsing ndg-builder\nWe provide a ndg-builder function, meant as an escape hatch when you are not interested in customizing NDG yourself. This abstracts away some of NDG's complexities at the cost of some performance overhead, and a more limited interface. In the case your needs are modest, you may be interested in using this option.\nManual Approach Using runCommandLocal\nIf you need more control, you can use runCommandLocal directly:\nThis approach correctly handles the generation of options documentation using nixosOptionsDoc and properly passes the result to NDG.\nPro Tips & Best Practices\nPerformance Optimization\nUse multi-threading for large documentation sets:\nSelectively disable features that you don't need:\n\nStyling Tips\nUse SCSS for complex stylesheets: ndg automatically compiles SCSS files, allowing you to use variables, nesting, and mixins.\nStart with exported templates: Always begin customization by exporting the default templates:\nCustomize specific pages: When using a template directory, you can have different templates for different page types:\n\nContent Organization\nUse consistent header levels: ndg generates the table of contents based on heading levels. Start with h1 (#) for the title, then use h2 (##) for major sections.\nStructure your options with depth in mind: The --options-depth parameter controls how the options TOC is generated. Organize your options to create a logical hierarchy.\nCreate an index.md file: Place an index.md file in your input directory to serve as the landing page.\n\nSpecial Files\nNDG treats certain files specially to maintain clear navigation hierarchy and ensure proper site structure. These files have behaviors that differ from regular documentation pages.\n[!TIP] What are \"Special Files\"?\nThe following files are considered \"special\" (case-insensitive):\nindex.md\nREADME.md\n\nIn the case neither special file, nor an options.json is provided; NDG will create a fallback page that links available documents in the project. You are encouraged to provide a README or an index page to avoid serving your users a mostly empty fallback page.\nSpecial file behaviors:\nLanding page priority (index.md only):\nPreferred source for the site's index.html landing page\nIf no index.md exists, NDG falls back to using options.html or creates a fallback index listing all documents\n\nSidebar rendering (both index.md and README.md):\nAlways appear first in the sidebar navigation\nExcluded from numbering by default when numbered = true in sidebar config\nCan be included in numbering by setting number_special_files = true\nCan have custom titles via sidebar pattern matching\n\n[!NOTE] Why this design? Special files represent conceptual entry points rather than sequential content:\nThey serve as landing pages or overviews outside the normal documentation flow\nNumbering them (e.g., \"1. Home\", \"2. Getting Started\") creates awkward visual hierarchy\nKeeping them unnumbered and first emphasizes their role as anchors\n\nWith sidebar numbering enabled (number_special_files = false, the default):\nRenders as:\nWith number_special_files = true:\nGitHub Integration\nLink to source with revision: Use the --revision option to specify a GitHub revision for source links:\n\nConfiguration Management\nCreate per-project config files: For projects with complex documentation, create a dedicated ndg.toml file:\n\nContent Enhancement\nUse admonitions for important content:\nCreate memorable custom ID anchors for important sections:\n\nBuilding from Source\nNDG is a tool written in Rust, and a Nix package is available for easily building and consuming it.\nIn the case you're planning to hack on NDG, .envrc is provided for Direnv integration and you may use cargo build inside a dev shell, e.g., by using nix develop.\nLicense\nThis project is made available under Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 2.0.
